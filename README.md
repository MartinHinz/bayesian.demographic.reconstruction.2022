## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

To perform the actual analysis, we recommend a powerful computer with a
multi-core processor, ideally with the Linux operating system, which has
at least 64GB RAM memory. In addition, a hard disk space of at least 5GB
should be reserved for the process.
